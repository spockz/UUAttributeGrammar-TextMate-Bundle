Clone into ~/Library/Application Support/TextMate for single user install, or
/Library/Application Support/TextMate for system wide install. This requires the
Haskell.tmbundle.

I noticed that it currently isn't available on the TextMate Bundles SVN Trunk
anymore. So you should maybe search some revisions. Otherwise contact me.
